# jay-and-co
full-stack & deployed scheduling application.

jayco.cloud is a custom application that allows users to create an account, profile, and book appointments.

From a technical perspective - jayco.cloud originated as a full-stack MongoDB Atlas, Express, React, and Node.js (MERN) application. The booking functionality is integrated with AWS Simple Email Service(SES)**. Redux is utilized to manage state between components, and React-Bootstrap provides layout/component structure and styling. PM2 is the production daemon process manager. Nginx functions as the web server and reverse proxy. The application is running on an Ubuntu Server Application Machine Image(AMI) on an Elastic Compute Cloud(EC2) instance. The Domain was purchased through namecheap, and the SSL Cert obtained through letsencrypt. You can review the publicly available code through the Github Repo.
